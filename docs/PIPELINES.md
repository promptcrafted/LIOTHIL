## Quick: which pipeline do I need?

| Your source material | Training goal | Pipeline |
|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Raw footage / movie rips / YouTube downloads | Character LoRA (I2V or T2V) | [1. Character from raw footage](#pipeline-1-character-from-raw-footage-triage-first) |
| Pre-cut clips (already trimmed) | Character LoRA (I2V or T2V) | [2. Character from pre-cut clips](#pipeline-2-character-from-pre-cut-clips) |
| Hand-picked clips showing a visual style | Style LoRA (T2V) | [3. Style LoRA](#pipeline-3-style-lora) |
| Clips selected for specific movement | Motion LoRA (T2V) | [4. Motion LoRA](#pipeline-4-motion-lora) |
| Existing dataset that needs fixing | Any | [5. Dataset cleanup](#pipeline-5-dataset-cleanup--re-normalization) |
| Raw footage targeting objects or settings | Concept LoRA (experimental) | [6. Other concept from raw footage](#pipeline-6-other-concept-from-raw-footage-experimental) |

**Still unsure?** Ask yourself two questions:
1. **Is your source already cut into short clips?** Yes → Pipeline 2-4. No → Pipeline 1 or 6.
2. **What are you training?** A character → Pipeline 1 or 2. A visual style → Pipeline 3. A motion pattern → Pipeline 4.

## Pipeline 1: Character from raw footage (triage-first)

**Train a character LoRA from long uncut video — movies, episodes, raw footage.**

### When to use this

- You have movie rips, YouTube downloads, or raw footage (minutes to hours long)
- You want clips of a specific character and need to skip everything else
- You have 1+ reference images of the character

Real-world example: 25 Breakfast at Tiffany's clips → triage found 162 Holly Golightly scenes out of ~1700 total. That's 90% less processing.

### What you need

- Source video file(s)
- A `concepts/` folder with reference image(s) in a `character/` subfolder
- An API key for captioning (Gemini, Replicate, or a local model via Ollama)

### The pipeline

```
raw videos
    │
    ▼
  triage ─────────► scene_triage_manifest.json
    │                   (review & edit)
    ▼
  ingest --triage ──► normalized clips (only matching scenes)
    │
    ├──► caption ───► .txt sidecar captions
    │
    ├──► extract ───► .png reference frames (for I2V)
    │
    ▼
  validate ─────────► ready for training
```

### Commands

Set up your concepts folder:
```
concepts/
  character/
    holly.jpg          ← reference image, filename becomes concept name
```

```powershell
# 1. Triage — find scenes containing your character
python -m dimljus.video triage "C:\path\to\raw\videos" -s concepts/

# 2. (Optional) Review scene_triage_manifest.json, flip include: true/false

# 3. Filtered ingest — split only matching scenes
python -m dimljus.video ingest "C:\path\to\raw\videos" -o clips --triage scene_triage_manifest.json

# 4. Caption
python -m dimljus.video caption clips -p gemini -u character -a "Holly Golightly"

# 5. Extract reference frames (for I2V training)
python -m dimljus.video extract clips -o clips/references

# 6. Validate
python -m dimljus.dataset validate clips
```

Skip step 5 if you're training T2V (text-to-video) — no reference frames needed.

For provider setup and API keys, see [WALKTHROUGH_SCRATCH.md — Step 3: Caption](WALKTHROUGH_SCRATCH.md#step-3-caption--generate-captions-via-vlm).

### What you end up with

```
clips/
  scene001.mp4          ← normalized training clip (16fps, 720p, 4n+1 frames)
  scene001.txt          ← "Holly Golightly walks down the street in her black dress."
  scene002.mp4
  scene002.txt
  ...
  references/
    scene001.png        ← first-frame reference (for I2V)
    scene002.png
```

### Organize (coming soon)

A dedicated organize step will structure this output for specific trainers (musubi-tuner, ai-toolkit). For now, the flat layout above works directly with most trainers.

---

## Pipeline 2: Character from pre-cut clips

**Train a character LoRA from clips that are already trimmed — client deliveries, previous projects, manually selected footage.**

### When to use this

- Your clips are already cut to individual scenes (under 30 seconds each)
- A human already curated which clips to use — no triage needed
- Clips might be wrong resolution, frame rate, or format for training

Real-world examples: Brand ambassador footage from a shoot, influencer content clips, product demos featuring a host.

### What you need

- A folder of pre-cut video clips
- An API key for captioning

### The pipeline

```
pre-cut clips
    │
    ▼
  scan ─────────────► report (what needs fixing)
    │
    ▼
  normalize ────────► training-spec clips (16fps, 720p)
    │
    ├──► caption ───► .txt sidecar captions
    │
    ├──► extract ───► .png reference frames (for I2V)
    │
    ▼
  validate ─────────► ready for training
```

### Commands

```powershell
# 1. Scan — see what needs normalizing
python -m dimljus.video scan "C:\path\to\clips"

# 2. Normalize — fix fps, resolution, frame count
python -m dimljus.video normalize "C:\path\to\clips" -o normalized

# 3. Caption
python -m dimljus.video caption normalized -p replicate -u character -a "Jinx"

# 4. Extract reference frames (for I2V)
python -m dimljus.video extract normalized -o normalized/references

# 5. Validate
python -m dimljus.dataset validate normalized
```

Skip step 4 for T2V training.

**Already have captions?** Skip step 3 entirely — normalize copies existing `.txt` sidecar files to the output folder automatically.

### What you end up with

Same structure as Pipeline 1 — normalized clips with captions and optional reference frames.

---

## Pipeline 3: Style LoRA

**Train a LoRA that captures a visual aesthetic — film noir, analog grain, anime studio style, retro VHS.**

### When to use this

- You've hand-picked clips that represent a specific visual style
- You care about the LOOK (color palette, grain, lighting, contrast), not specific subjects
- Training T2V only — no reference frames needed

Real-world examples: Film noir lighting from classic movies, Studio Ghibli's color palette, 80s VHS aesthetic, cinematic anamorphic lens look.

### What you need

- A folder of clips selected for their visual style
- An API key for captioning

### The pipeline

```
style clips
    │
    ▼
  normalize ────────► training-spec clips
    │
    ▼
  caption (-u style) ► .txt captions describing CONTENT (not style)
    │
    ▼
  validate ─────────► ready for training
```

### Commands

```powershell
# 1. Normalize
python -m dimljus.video normalize "C:\path\to\clips" -o normalized

# 2. Caption with style use-case
python -m dimljus.video caption normalized -p gemini -u style

# 3. Validate
python -m dimljus.dataset validate normalized
```

### Why no anchor word?

Style LoRAs don't use `-a` (anchor word). The model learns the style from the visual patterns across all clips — you don't need a trigger word.

### Why `-u style` matters

The `style` use-case tells the captioner to describe **what's happening** in the clip, not how it looks. "A woman walks down a rainy street" — not "A noir-lit scene with high contrast shadows." The model learns the visual style from the pixels; the caption teaches it what content to associate the style with.

### What you end up with

```
normalized/
  clip_001.mp4          ← training clip
  clip_001.txt          ← "A woman walks down a rainy street at night."
  clip_002.mp4
  clip_002.txt
```

No reference frames — this is T2V only.

---

## Pipeline 4: Motion LoRA

**Train a LoRA that captures specific movement patterns — camera orbits, slow motion, walk cycles, explosion dynamics.**

### When to use this

- You've selected clips for their movement, not their visual content
- You care about HOW things move, not what they look like
- Training T2V only

Real-world examples: Smooth camera orbit around a subject, slow-mo water splash, anime run cycle, drone flyover.

### What you need

- A folder of clips selected for their motion pattern
- An API key for captioning

### The pipeline

```
motion clips
    │
    ▼
  normalize ────────► training-spec clips
    │
    ▼
  caption (-u motion) ► .txt captions focused on movement
    │
    ▼
  validate ─────────► ready for training
```

### Commands

```powershell
# 1. Normalize
python -m dimljus.video normalize "C:\path\to\clips" -o normalized

# 2. Caption with motion use-case
python -m dimljus.video caption normalized -p gemini -u motion

# 3. Validate
python -m dimljus.dataset validate normalized
```

### Why `-u motion` matters

The `motion` use-case makes captions focus on **movement and camera behavior**: "The camera slowly orbits around the subject while they stand still." Not "A person stands in a park" — the caption needs to teach the model what the movement IS so it can reproduce it from text prompts.

### What you end up with

Same structure as Pipeline 3 — clips with motion-focused captions, no reference frames.

---

## Pipeline 5: Dataset cleanup / re-normalization

**Fix an existing dataset — wrong specs, inherited from another project, migrating between trainers.**

### When to use this

- You have a dataset that's already captioned but the videos are wrong resolution/fps
- You downloaded a community-shared dataset and need to adapt it to your specs
- You're migrating from one trainer to another and need to re-validate

Real-world examples: Inherited a dataset at 24fps and need 16fps for Wan, downloaded clips at 1080p and need 720p, switching from ai-toolkit to musubi-tuner format.

### What you need

- An existing dataset folder with clips (and hopefully captions)

### The pipeline

```
existing dataset
    │
    ▼
  scan ─────────────► what needs fixing
    │
    ▼
  normalize ────────► re-encoded clips (copies .txt sidecars)
    │
    ▼
  score ────────────► caption quality report (no API needed)
    │
    ▼
  validate ─────────► completeness check
```

### Commands

```powershell
# 1. Scan — see what's off
python -m dimljus.video scan "C:\path\to\dataset"

# 2. Normalize — fix specs, copies existing captions
python -m dimljus.video normalize "C:\path\to\dataset" -o fixed

# 3. Score captions (optional, no API needed)
python -m dimljus.video score fixed

# 4. Validate
python -m dimljus.dataset validate fixed
```

### Key detail: normalize preserves captions

When you normalize, existing `.txt` sidecar files are copied alongside the re-encoded clips. You don't lose your captions. If the captions are fine, you never need to re-caption.

The `score` command checks caption quality (length, structure, repetition) without calling any API — it's purely local analysis. Use it to spot low-quality captions in inherited datasets.

### What you end up with

A clean dataset with correct video specs and your existing captions preserved.

## Pipeline 6: Other concept from raw footage (experimental)

**Target objects, settings, or custom concepts from long uncut video. Same pipeline as Pipeline 1, but results need manual review.**

### When to use this

- You want to extract clips of a specific product, location, or object from raw footage
- You have reference images of the concept

Real-world examples: A specific product across marketing footage, a recurring location in a series, a particular prop or vehicle.

### What you need

Same as Pipeline 1, but with reference images in the appropriate concept subfolder:

```
concepts/
  object/
    product.jpg
  setting/
    office.jpg
```

### The pipeline

Same flow as Pipeline 1:

```
raw videos → triage → manifest review → ingest --triage → caption → extract → validate
```

### Commands

```powershell
# 1. Triage
python -m dimljus.video triage "C:\path\to\raw\videos" -s concepts/

# 2. REVIEW the manifest — this is critical for non-character concepts
#    Open scene_triage_manifest.json and check the matches

# 3. Filtered ingest
python -m dimljus.video ingest "C:\path\to\raw\videos" -o clips --triage scene_triage_manifest.json

# 4. Caption (use -u object for objects/products)
python -m dimljus.video caption clips -p gemini -u object -a "the product name"

# 5. Extract + validate
python -m dimljus.video extract clips -o clips/references
python -m dimljus.dataset validate clips
```

### Why this is experimental

CLIP-based triage works differently for non-character concepts:

- **Characters**: CLIP matches identity well — it recognizes the same person across angles, lighting, and distance. Production-ready.
- **Objects/settings**: CLIP matches visual similarity, not semantic identity. A "cat" reference might match scenes with similar framing or color palette, not just scenes containing a cat.

This means you'll get false positives. The triage still saves you a huge amount of manual work, but **you must review the manifest before ingesting**. Flip `include: false` on scenes that don't actually contain your concept.

### Cascade problem

If triage mismatches a scene, the anchor word gets baked into the caption for a clip that doesn't contain the concept. A wrong caption is worse than no caption. This is why manifest review matters — catch the mistakes before they enter your training data.

### Improvement roadmap

Better non-character triage accuracy is planned — this includes concept-type-specific matching strategies and confidence calibration. For now, the manual review step is your quality gate.

## Concept type reliability

How well does CLIP-based triage work for different concept types?

| Concept type | Triage reliability | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Character** | Production-ready | CLIP recognizes human identity well across angles, lighting, distance. Tested end-to-end on real data. |
| **Object** | Experimental | Matches visual similarity, not semantic identity. Manual manifest review required. |
| **Setting** | Experimental | Same limitation — matches framing/palette, not "this specific place." Review your results. |
| **Style** | Not applicable | Style LoRAs use hand-picked clips, not triage. Use Pipeline 3. |
| **Motion** | Not applicable | Motion LoRAs use hand-picked clips, not triage. Use Pipeline 4. |

For characters, trust the triage. For everything else, use it as a first pass and review the manifest before ingesting.
