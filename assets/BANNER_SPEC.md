# LIOTHIL Banner Spec — For Timothy to Execute in Canva

## Reference
Minta's LoRA Gym banner: `assets/minta-banner-reference.png`
Same structural grammar, different symbolic register.

## Dimensions
1280 x 320px (standard GitHub repo banner, same as Minta's)

## Layer 1: Background
Screenshot of actual LIOTHIL code — the CLAUDE.md file open in a dark
theme editor (VS Code Dark+ or similar). Show the section around:

```
## PHASE 1 — THE INTERVIEW

Conduct this interview conversationally. Not a form — a dialogue.
```

Or the operational principles section:

```
8. **Sparse results are data, not failure.**
9. **When the investigator pushes back, re-read the source.**
```

Line numbers visible. Syntax highlighting on. The code IS the product —
showing it communicates what LIOTHIL is before anyone reads a word.

Crop so the code is slightly blurred or at ~70% opacity — readable enough
to see it's real code, soft enough not to compete with the overlay.

## Layer 2: Overlay
Semi-transparent rectangle, same position as Minta's (left-aligned,
vertically centered, covering ~40% of the width).

**Color: Deep amber/gold (#D4A017 or similar)** at ~80% opacity.
Gold = alchemy, transformation, the solar terminus. Different from
Minta's cyan but same energy — bright, confident, electric.

Alternative if gold feels too warm: **indigo (#4B0082)** — the esoteric
register, night hours, the deep work.

## Layer 3: Title Text
"LIOTHIL" in a pixel/8-bit font — same family as Minta's "ALVDANSEN
LORA GYM" text. This is where brand convergence happens. Same font
family = same product family.

**Font suggestions (all free, all pixel/8-bit):**
- Press Start 2P (Google Fonts — the classic)
- VT323 (Google Fonts — terminal/CRT feel)
- Silkscreen (Google Fonts — clean pixel)

White or off-white text (#FFFFFF or #F5F5DC).

## Layer 4: Pixel Art Icon
Instead of Minta's space invader, use a **pixel falcon** — 16x16 or
32x32 pixel art. LIOTHIL is the first of the Five Falcon Names. The
falcon is both the Damanhurian symbol (Falco = falcon) and the Egyptian
Horus connection (EOROS = the Falcon-Headed One).

Simple: 5-7 colors max. Facing right (looking forward). Could also be
a simplified **Eye of Horus** in pixel art — more immediately readable
as "esoteric" to people who don't know the falcon connection.

Third option: a **pixel ∀** — the breath-zero glyph, instantly
recognizable to anyone who's seen the Falco project, meaningfully
cryptic to everyone else. Just the inverted A in pixel form.

**Color: Match the overlay amber, or use a contrasting purple/indigo**
to mirror the purple creature in Minta's banner.

## Layer 5: Tagline (Optional)
Below or beside the title, in a smaller pixel font or monospace:
"research environment scaffold"
or
"the helper"
or
"458"

Small. Understated. Not required — the clean title alone works.

## The Convergence
When someone sees both banners side by side:
- Same structure (code background + colored overlay + pixel font + icon)
- Same energy (playful meets serious, retro meets production)
- Different domain (cyan/gaming vs. gold/esoteric)
- Same product family (Promptcrafted)

The message: these people make tools. Serious tools. With personality.

## Notes
- Delete `minta-banner-reference.png` before committing (it's her work,
  reference only)
- Final banner goes to `assets/banner.png`
- README references it as `![LIOTHIL](assets/banner.png)`
