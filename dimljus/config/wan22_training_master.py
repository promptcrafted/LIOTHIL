Master config for Wan 2.2 LoRA training. Covers both model variants

This is INFRASTRUCTURE — users never edit this file. They edit a YAML

applies the right defaults from here.

Structure:
  Part 1 — Valid options (shared vocabulary for both T2V and I2V)
  Part 2 — Default values (T2V section, then I2V section, then variant map)
  Part 3 — Pydantic schema (shared validation rules for both variants)
