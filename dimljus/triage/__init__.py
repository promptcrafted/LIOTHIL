"""Clip triage — sort clips by content using reference image matching.

Triage is the step between splitting/normalizing and captioning.
It matches video clips against user-provided reference images to
automatically categorize scenes by concept type (character, setting, style, etc.).

Three modes:
  1. Reference-guided: user provides reference images in concepts/ folder
  2. Zero-shot: model auto-groups similar clips (future)
  3. Manual: user sorts clips themselves (no triage needed)

Usage:
    python -m dimljus.video triage <clips_dir> --concepts <concepts_dir>
