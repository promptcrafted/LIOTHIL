"""Zero-shot content filters for triage.

Uses CLIP's text-image matching to detect frames that are useless
for training: title cards, credits, text overlays, black frames, etc.

CLIP is already loaded during triage, so this adds zero extra cost
beyond encoding a few text prompts (instant) and comparing them
against frame embeddings we already have.

How it works:
    1. Encode a set of text prompts describing unwanted content
    2. For each clip's sampled frames, compare against these prompts
    3. If the BEST frame-to-prompt similarity exceeds a threshold,
       flag the clip as that content type

This is intentionally conservative — false negatives (missing a
title card) are harmless, but false positives (rejecting a good
training clip) waste data.
