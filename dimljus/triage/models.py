"""Data models for clip triage — sorting clips by content.

Triage matches video clips against user-provided reference images to
automatically categorize scenes. A reference photo of a character gets
matched against sampled frames from each clip using CLIP embeddings.

Concept types correspond to captioning use cases — once clips are
triaged, the right captioning prompt is automatically selected.

TYPE_ALIASES maps common folder names to canonical types so users
don't have to memorize exact names. "humans/" works just as well
as "character/".
