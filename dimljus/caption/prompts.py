"""Prompt templates for VLM captioning.

Each use case gets a tailored prompt that tells the VLM what to describe
and — critically — what to OMIT. The LoRA learns what you leave out.

- character LoRA: DON'T describe appearance (the LoRA teaches that)
- style LoRA: DON'T describe art style/medium (the LoRA teaches that)
- motion LoRA: DON'T describe identity, focus on movement
- object LoRA: DON'T describe the object, describe context

Captions should read like GENERATION PROMPTS — short, direct,
comma-separated phrases. Not prose, not narration, not film analysis.

Good: "close-up, jinx looks up at the open sky"
Bad:  "It's a close-up of Jinx, shot from below, as she looks intently up at the open sky."

Framing (closeup, wide shot, etc.) leads as a tag when notable.
The anchor word is used as a natural name, not mechanically prepended.
