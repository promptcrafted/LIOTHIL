"""Dimljus dataset validation data models.

Models for dataset-level validation: structure detection, sample pairing,
per-sample and per-dataset issue tracking, and aggregate reporting.

These operate at a higher level than dimljus.video.models — they describe
relationships BETWEEN files (clip ↔ caption ↔ reference image) rather than
properties of a single file.

All models are immutable (frozen) — they represent facts about a dataset's
state, not mutable processing state.
