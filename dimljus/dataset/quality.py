"""Dataset quality metrics: exposure, motion, perceptual hashing.

Pure measurement functions — path in, number out. Follows the same
pattern as dimljus.video.image_quality (compute_sharpness). Each metric
is independent and can be used standalone.

Why these three:
- Exposure: catches under/overexposed frames that wash out VAE encoding
- Motion: catches static shots (useless for video) and chaotic motion (unlearnable)
- dHash: catches near-duplicate images that waste training compute

dHash is implemented manually in numpy (~15 lines) to avoid adding
imagehash as a dependency. It's the simplest perceptual hash that still
works well for near-duplicate detection.
