"""WanModelBackend — implements the ModelBackend protocol for Wan models.

This is the real model backend that replaces Phase 7's stubs. It handles:
    - Loading WanTransformer3DModel from disk
    - Determining LoRA targets for the variant
    - Computing expert masks from timesteps
    - Preparing inputs for the Wan forward pass
    - Running the forward pass
    - Setting up gradient checkpointing

For MoE models (Wan 2.2), the backend loads one expert at a time.
Expert switching happens at phase transitions via one of two strategies:

    - **Disk reload** (default): the old expert is deleted, GPU memory
      reclaimed, and the new expert loaded fresh from disk. Slower
      (~30s) but uses no extra CPU RAM. Works on any machine.

    - **State-dict swap** (preload_experts=True): both expert state
      dicts are loaded at startup. The inactive one lives on CPU.
      Switching uses load_state_dict(assign=True) — nearly instant
      (~3s). Requires ~27GB extra CPU RAM for the inactive dict.
      Best for cloud pods or machines with 64GB+ RAM.

Requires: torch, diffusers, peft (the 'wan' dependency group).
