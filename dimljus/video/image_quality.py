"""Image quality scoring for extracted reference images.

Uses OpenCV to compute sharpness (Laplacian variance) and detect
blank/uniform frames. These are the quality gates that prevent garbage
reference images from corrupting the VAE latent representation.

WHY Laplacian variance: the Laplacian operator detects edges and
texture. A sharp image has high Laplacian variance (lots of detail).
A blurry or blank image has low variance (uniform regions). This is
the standard computational sharpness metric — simple, fast, robust.

All functions work on file paths (not pre-loaded arrays) so they
can be used standalone from the CLI without loading OpenCV upfront.

    Loads the image as grayscale, applies the Laplacian operator

    - Blank/solid color: < 1.0
    - Very blurry: 1-50
    - Normal video frame: 50-500
    - Sharp photograph: 500-5000+
