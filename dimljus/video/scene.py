"""Scene detection via PySceneDetect.

Detects scene cuts in video files — both for splitting long videos into
training clips AND for verifying that pre-cut clips have no cuts
(temporal coherence is essential for video training).

PySceneDetect is an optional dependency. If not installed, functions
raise SceneDetectNotFoundError with install instructions.
