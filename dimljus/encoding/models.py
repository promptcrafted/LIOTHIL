"""Dimljus encoding pipeline data models.

Models for the full encoding pipeline: discovery → expansion → bucketing →
encoding → caching. Each model represents a specific stage:

    DiscoveredSample   — one source file set BEFORE expansion
    ExpandedSample     — one concrete training sample AFTER expansion
    CacheEntry         — one sample's cache state on disk
    CacheManifest      — complete cache state (all entries + metadata)

All models are immutable (frozen) — they represent facts about data state,
not mutable processing state.
