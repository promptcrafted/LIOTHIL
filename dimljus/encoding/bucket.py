"""Area-based bucketing for latent pre-encoding.

Production bucketing that assigns training samples to (W, H, F) buckets.
Unlike Phase 4's preview bucketing (which just snaps to grid), this module
generates the actual bucket set and assigns samples to the closest match.

Bucketing ensures every sample in a batch has identical dimensions —
no padding waste, efficient GPU utilization. The bucket set is generated
from configurable constraints:

    - Target area (total pixels): controls VRAM usage per sample
    - Aspect ratio range: prevents extreme distortion
    - Resolution step: alignment for VAE compatibility (usually 16px)
    - Frame counts: which temporal lengths to support (4n+1 for Wan)

Two entry points:
    - generate_buckets(): creates the set of valid (W, H) spatial buckets
    - assign_buckets(): maps ExpandedSamples to their nearest bucket
